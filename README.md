# About

In previous years there have been many corpora of parliamentary proceedings created. One of the most extensive projects, covering a wide range of languages and European parliaments , is the ParlaMint project (Erjavec et al., 2022). The corpora of this project share a uniform encoding and already include metadata, which is not yet equally rich across the individual corpora.
This thesis seeks to investigate, if an automated process for enriching the missing corpus metadata with the help of the knowledge base Wikidata is viable. 
Beyond the enrichment of metadata, the paper aims to provide two forms of cross-checking using Wikidata. 
The first form of cross-checking includes adding pages on the knowledge base, for persons of the corpora who were found to not yet have a entry on the knowledge base. The data which is added to the knowledge base is the metadata given in the corpora before the enrichment process performed in this thesis. 
The second form of cross-checking entails a comparison of corpus data to data from the knowledge base, to check the data for inconsistencies. This is performed on the corpus metadata pre-enrichment. The differences are noted and visualized using a XSLT stylesheet, where they can be accessed and used further for manual corrections.
